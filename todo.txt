- TeX front-end.
- Make it compile to Clean and call the compiler Janitor.
- Insert the operation-implementing functions into the algebraic token types to reduce clutter in the runtime.
- Put some actual effort into the token converter so it doesn't break whenever I re-order the character set.
- Add actually descriptive error messages for when files can't be parsed or runtime errors occur.
- Move `random` member into `state` instead of `memory`
- PRIORITY:
	- fix the stack-overflow bug with loops
	- implement the set operators
