- TeX front-end.
- Make it compile to Clean and call the compiler Janitor.
- Insert the operation implementing functions into the algebraic token types to reduce clutter in the runtime.

	- this might allow the problem with non-terminating programs blowing the heap to be avoided when using *World for input
