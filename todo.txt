- TeX front-end.
- Make it compile to Clean and call the compiler Janitor.
- Insert the operation-implementing functions into the algebraic token types to reduce clutter in the runtime.
- Put some actual effort into the token converter so it doesn't break whenever I re-order the character set.
- Add actually descriptive error messages for when files can't be parsed or runtime errors occur.
- Move `random` member into `state` instead of `memory`
- PRIORITY:
	- change group operator to work on primary stack
	- change delimiter system to numbered delimiters with active storage
	- review operators that alter cursor position or add delimiters
		- numeric-returns should at most add a stack
		- stack-returns should add a delimiter
		- multi-returns should always add and set the cursor
	- stop the cursor position from updating conditionally based on relative distance
	- make cursor movement wrapping
		- moving down one from the bottom goes to the top
		- shifting down one from the bottom adds one below the top
		- shifting up one from the top sets the bottom active and removes the delim at the top
	- implement the set operators
